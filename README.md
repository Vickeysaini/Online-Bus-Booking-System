This project is modularized as the following:
	Management of Route
	Trip Details
	Bus Details
	Bus Ticketing


1. Management of Routes
    This module include information about  how we can Manage the routes for a particular bus services so   In  the case of Route management module we must know the details about  route number, number  of stops ,fare  stages and running time of  the  particular bus more over we want to manipulate and    stored these information successfully.
2. Trip information
     Each journey is identified as a trip. Each ticket must contain the trip no so that calculation of passenger can be done easily. Here in this section we want to know start time and route no of the bus this information can be manipulate and stored successfully.
3. Bus Detail 
                     In this module all bus details are stored and manipulated, in bus detail module contains minimum charge, type, depot, fare increment, bus number, and passenger’s states (child or adult) are manipulate and stored.
4. Bus Ticketing
          Ticketing is the most important module in this Project which uses all the tables together and calculates fare for the passengers.  Venting the tickets is done using the route number, bus type, beginning stop, end stop, ticket number, persons(Adult/child)rate, date and time  also we want to print the all these information.  In order to do the calculation data has to be pulled out from stops, bus, trip and route. Number of passengers & the states are entered by the Venter and to produce the tickets.

10. Here is the link of our Github repository:

Now from here you can create your own project or you just open it in your visual studio. Database query is also available there.
Now execute your project by setting Default.aspx webform as startup page...
•	So this is our startup page:
